# ICD2O-Final-Project

This program is a game where the player controls a worm that is constantly moving around on a grid based screen. Leaves will spawn in random locations across the screen, and the player's goal is to eat as many as they can. When the worm eats these leaves, it grows in length, crowding the screen even more. The player loses when the worm collides with itself or the side of the screen.
